# TrustPay – Hack36 

![BUILT AT](https://postimage.me/images/2025/04/19/built-at-hack36.png)

## 🧩 Introduction:
Traditional online transactions between strangers lack trust. For example:
- A buyer might pay and never receive the item.
- A seller might send the item and never get paid.
- Third-party escrow services exist but charge high fees and can be centralized or untrustworthy.

### ✅ TrustPay solves this by:
- Offering a trustless escrow mechanism using smart contracts.
- Automating fund release based on mutual confirmation.
- Charging no platform fees (only network gas).
